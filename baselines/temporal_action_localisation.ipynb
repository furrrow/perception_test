The Perception Test dataset introduces real-world videos designed to show perceptually interesting situations and defines multiple computational tasks (object and point tracking, action and sound localisation, multiple-choice and grounded video question-answering). Here, we provide details and a baseline for the temporal action localisation task.\n",
